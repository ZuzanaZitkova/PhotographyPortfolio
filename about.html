              My photography journey is an unexpected yet beautiful path that
              unfolded as I embarked on life's adventures. Hailing from the
              Czech Republic, I pursued a degree in mathematics teaching at
              university. At the age of 23, I married an amazing man, and
              together, we took a leap of faith, moving to the stunning
              landscapes of New Zealand.

              It was in this picturesque country, four years ago, that I
              discovered my passion for photography. Nature's grandeur beckoned
              me, and I began capturing its essence through my lens. The
              transition to photographing people and creating simple portraits
              followed naturally. Each click of the shutter allowed me to tell
              unique stories.

            <p>
              Now, as I contemplate venturing into product photography, I
              reflect on this incredible journey. It has been a gradual, organic
              process that has enriched my life with creativity and joy. Every
              step has deepened my love for photography, making it an integral
              part of who I am.
